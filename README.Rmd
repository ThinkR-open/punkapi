## About

This repo contains an exercise for a training on package building. 

The `{punkapi}` package will contain functions to call the Punk API. 
Documentation is at: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2

## How to

The list of tasks are at https://github.com/ThinkR-open/punkapi/issues

These issues contain a series of functions to implement/issue to fix. 

Step by step:

1. Clone this repo to your computer
1. Comment one issue to indicate you want to work on it
1. Create a new branch, starting from `dev`, named `issue-XXX`, where `XXX` is the issue you want to work on
1. Once you've done the implementation, make sure your branch is up-to-date with `dev`
1. Make a PR to `dev`
1. Your branch should pass the GitHub Action check to be valid
1. Tag @colinfay as a reviewer

## Requirements

1. Every function should check the user inputs, 
1. Every function should fail gracefully (i.e return informative messages)
1. Every function should be fully documented
1. Every dependency should be fully set
